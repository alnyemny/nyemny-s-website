            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="Main">So I am a passionate programmer of 14 y-o named Sofiane with experience in multiple programming languages and development technologies. My journey in coding started, where I developed an interest in how things work under the hood of computers.</p>
            
            <p class="About-me">so I first learned Python after watching several "How to Start Programming" videos. After completing some basic projects like "Hello World," a small snake game using Pygame, and experimenting with libraries like Manim, I tackled a few Leetcode problems (which, let's just say, traumatized me a bit). I then moved on to HTML/CSS (no js here) and built several websites. However, I eventually got bored, so I naturally turned to Unity, the game engine, and started learning C#. After a long journey in tutorial hell, I finally found a proper C# tutorial that helped me break free. And now, here I am!</p>
